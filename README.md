## Description <a name="description"></a>
The Book Search Engine is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Originally utilizing a RESTful API, it has been refactored to implement a GraphQL API powered by Apollo Server. This application allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save them to their account, and manage their saved books. Authentication is implemented to allow users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
